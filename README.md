 ### IP-Adapter
Effective and lightweight adapter to achieve image prompt capability for the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. An IP-Adapter with only 22M parameters can achieve comparable or even better performance to a fine-tuned image prompt model. IP-Adapter can be generalized not only to other custom models fine-tuned from the same base model, but also to controllable generation using existing controllable tools. Moreover, the image prompt can also work well with the text prompt to accomplish multimodal image generation.
